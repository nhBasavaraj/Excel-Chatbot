# llm-agent Approach

## Overview

The `llm-agent` approach involves utilizing Jupyter notebooks to interact with the LLM (Language Model) agent for generating responses based on a set of questions. Two notebooks are provided for different datasets: `CSV_LLM-Agent-Facebook.ipynb` for Facebook data and `dummy-CSV_LLM-Agent.ipynb` for dummy Orders data. The responses generated by the LLM agent are saved in corresponding PDF files: `CSV_LLM-Agent-Facebook-response.pdf` and `dummy-CSV_LLM-Agent-response.pdf`.

## Files

1. **CSV_LLM-Agent-Facebook.ipynb:**
   - This Jupyter notebook uses the Facebook CSV dataset.
   - The `csv-llm-agent` is used to ask a set of questions (found in the `data-source` folder), and the responses are saved in `CSV_LLM-Agent-Facebook-response.pdf`.

2. **dummy-CSV_LLM-Agent.ipynb:**
   - This Jupyter notebook uses a dummy Orders CSV dataset.
   - The `csv-llm-agent` is used to ask a set of questions, and the responses are saved in `dummy-CSV_LLM-Agent-response.pdf`.

3. **CSV_LLM-Agent-Facebook-response.pdf:**
   - This PDF file stores the responses generated by the LLM agent in response to the set of questions related to the Facebook dataset.

4. **dummy-CSV_LLM-Agent-response.pdf:**
   - This PDF file stores the responses generated by the LLM agent in response to a set of questions related to the dummy Orders dataset.

## Usage

To use the `llm-agent` approach, follow these steps:

1. Open the respective Jupyter notebook, either `CSV_LLM-Agent-Facebook.ipynb` or `dummy-CSV_LLM-Agent.ipynb`.

2. Execute the notebook cells to interact with the `csv-llm-agent` and generate responses.

3. Refer to the corresponding response PDF (`CSV_LLM-Agent-Facebook-response.pdf` or `dummy-CSV_LLM-Agent-response.pdf`) for the LLM agent's responses to the set of questions.

4. Adjust the input data or set of questions as needed for your specific use case.

## Data Source

The set of questions for testing the LLM agent can be found in the `data-source` folder.
